# Remove GitHub contributions calendar

A user script to "ungamify" GitHub, at least in part.

## What?

Just what it says. With this script installed, your GitHub profile page will not include the contribution calendar, streak info, or your recent commit activity timeline.

## Why?

Because people seem to care.

## How?

In Firefox, you'll need the [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) addon to run user scripts.

In Safari, I guess there's [NinjaKit](https://github.com/os0x/NinjaKit), but I haven't tried it, so I don't know if it works.

In Chrome, apparently it can run user scripts natively? But if it can't, I hear Tampermonkey, from the Chrome app store, is good.

In Internet Explorer, you're probably hosed. Sorry.

Once you have whatever prerequisites you need, [visit the user script directly](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aaron-em/remove-github-contributions-calendar.user.js/master/remove-github-contributions-calendar.user.js) and you should be prompted to install.

Once the script is installed, it should work automatically. There's no option to disable it yet. If you want one, open an issue and I'll add one.
